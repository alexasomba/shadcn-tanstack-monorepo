# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Package Source Inspection

No local vendoring. Use `opensrc path <package>` + `rg`/`sed`.

- Search: `rg "query" $(opensrc path <package>)`
- Read: `cat $(opensrc path <package>)/path/to/file`
- Other registries: `find $(opensrc path pypi:requests) -name "*.py"`

## Git & Verification Rules

- Never bypass git hooks (e.g., do not use `--no-verify`). Instead, always debug and resolve the underlying issues causing validation or hook failures.
- If you want to start new work and the repo is dirty, start in a git worktree. We default to using worktrees and never create/use local branches; all work is done directly on the `preview` branch and pushed to remote when completed (completion of a task is defined as being pushed to remote).
